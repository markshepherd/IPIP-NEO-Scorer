Warning about this 120-Item Version of the IPIP-NEO</h2>

<ul>
<li>
Thus far, no program failures for the 120-item version of the IPIP-NEO
have been reported for persons who have answered all of the items. However, recently a number of individuals have reported that the program tells them they have not checked the two acknowledgement boxes on this page, even when they have. For some reason, this may occur with older web browsers, so if this happens to you, you might consider trying again with a more recent version of Netscape or Microsoft Internet Explorer. (This is not an endorsement of those browsers, just a workaround suggestion.)</li>

<li>
To access the test, you <u>must</u> indicate that you understand that taking
the test does not guarantee receiving results.</li>

<li>
You indicate this understanding by clicking the checkbox below.</li>
</ul>
<form method="post" action="./shortipipneo1.cgi">
<table cols="1" width="100%">
<tbody><tr>
<td><input type="CHECKBOX" name="Risk" value="Yes"><b>Yes, I understand
that responding to all items on this inventory is time consuming and that
technical difficulties may prevent the results from being displayed. I
am responding to this inventory with the full knowledge of the risk that
I might not receive results. I accept full responsibility and risk for
the time I invest in responding to this inventory.</b></td>

<h2>
If the Program Does Crash...</h2>
..and you are using an older web browser, first try using a newer browser.
A number of people have recently reported overcoming problems simply by
using a newer browser. Whatever your problem, I want to know about it.
If you experience any technical difficulties (items fail to appear on the
screen, test does not advance to next page, web browser freezes, no narrative
report is displayed, etc.) I encourage you to send an email describing
the problem to me at <b><a href="mailto:j5j@psu.edu">j5j@psu.edu</a>.
</b>Other
persons who may have referred you to this site would prefer that you report
technical difficulties to me rather than to them.
<h2>
Purpose of this On-Line Inventory</h2>

<ul>
<li>
The primary purpose of this on line inventory is to educate the public
about the <a href="http://www.centacs.com/quickstart.htm">five factor model
of personality</a>.</li>

<li>
More specifically, the report explains the likely consequences of one's
standing on five broad personality domains.</li>

<li>
These broad domains cover normal differences in personality that should
be obvious to people who know you well.</li>

<li>
Secondarily, this inventory estimates your standing on the 5 broad domains
and 30 subdomains of personality.</li>

<li>
The inventory does not reveal hidden, secret information about you nor
does it assess serious psychological disorders.</li>

<li>
The report is designed to be objective, not pleasing or flattering.</li>

<li>
Measurement error, misunderstandings, carelessness, and mischievous responding
can invalidate the report.</li>

<li>
If knowledgeable acquaintances disagree with the test results, then the
results are wrong.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
Acknowledgment that You Understand the Limitations of the Test Results</h2>
<u>Before you can access the test, you must endorse the statement below
by clicking the checkbox</u>.
<table cols="1" width="100%">
<tbody><tr>
<td><input type="CHECKBOX" name="Accuracy" value="Yes"><b>Yes, I understand
that the primary purpose of this site is to educate the public about the
five factor model of personality, and only secondarily, to estimate the
respondent's standing within the five factor model. I understand that the
program that generates the report is designed to produce estimates that
are as accurate as possible, but that measurement error or improper responding
can
produce inaccurate results. If I think I have answered the items honestly
and carefully but my results are inaccurate or not as pleasing as I would
like them to be, I will have knowledgeable acquaintances evaluate the validity
of the report before contacting Dr. Johnson. If I choose to critique the
test or narrative report after receiving feedback from knowledgeable acquaintances,
I will do so in a courteous and civil manner.</b></td>

<b>For Further Information</b></h2>

<ul>
<li>
The full IPIP contains 1,699 items assembled by Dr. Lewis R. Goldberg.
The URL for Dr. Goldberg's IPIP is <a href="http://ipip.ori.org/">http://ipip.ori.org/</a>
. The IPIP is in the public domain and its items can be freely downloaded
from that site.</li>

<li>
The IPIP-NEO is <b><u>not</u></b> equivalent to the commercial inventory
on which it is based, the NEO PI-R™, authored by Paul T. Costa, Jr. and
Robert R. McCrae. The genuine NEO PI-R™ (240 items) is considered by many
psychologists to be the best inventory for measuring traits within the
Five Factor Model (FFM) of personality. The NEO PI-R™ is copyrighted by
Psychological Assessment Resources (PAR) in Florida, and can only be ordered
by professionals and used by permission. You can contact PAR at: 1-800-331-TEST,
or <a href="http://www.parinc.com/">http://www.parinc.com</a>.</li>

<li>
The scoring and narrative report routines for these items were created
by Dr. John A. Johnson, Professor of Psychology, Penn State University.</li>

<li>
Any programmer who wishes to examine the Perl CGI scripts underlying this
inventory, or anyone with further questions may contact John A. Johnson
at <b><a href="mailto:j5j@psu.edu">j5j@psu.edu</a>.</b></li>
</ul>

<b>Acknowledgements</b></h2>
Dr. Johnson would like to thank Robin Lowenthal for her invaluable debugging
assistance and Thore Harald Hoye for his programming advice. Neither of
these individuals is responsible for any errors that may remain in the
program.
